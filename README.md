# Handling-Changes

In this project, you will
practice handling changes
in React by building a 
simple form component.
The form will have input
fields for the user's name
and email address, and
you will implement
functionality to handle
changes in these input
fields and display the 
updated values.

Step 1: Set up the project

- Create a new React project
using your preferred method
(Create React App or manual setup).
- Set up the necessary 
file structure for your project.

Step 2: Create the Form component

- Create a new file named
"Form.js" in your project's
component directory.
- In "Form.js," import the
necessary React dependencies
- Create a functional component
named "Form" and export it
as the default export.
- Inside the component, define
the initial state
using the useState hook.
- Create an event handler
function to handle changes
in the input fields

Step 3: Build the form UI

- In the "Form" component,
return a JSX element
representing the form.
- Save the changes and ensure
that the form component is
rendered correctly in
the parent component.

Step 4: Test the form

- Start your React development
server and open the app
in your browser.
- Verify that the form renders
correctly with the input
fields for name and email.
-Type into the input fields
and observe that the state
is updated accordingly.

Step 5: Display the form data

- Modify the "Form" component
to display the current form
data below the input fields.
- Save the changes and test
the form again. Verify that
the form data is displayed
correctly below the input fields.

Step 6: Style the form (optional)

- Add CSS styles to the form
and its components to make
it visually appealing.
- Customize the form layout,
colors, font styles, etc.,
to match your preferences
or project requirements.

Remember to create a styles.css
file in the same directory as
Form.js and App.js and import it
in your HTML file or the root
component file if you're using
a tool like Create React App.
